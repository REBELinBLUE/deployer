## Usage in production

The `master` branch of this repository is a development branch and **should not** be used in production. Changes are merged into the `release` branch when they are considered stable and may then be tagged for release at any time. It is recommended that you use the latest tag [release](https://github.com/REBELinBLUE/deployer/releases) for production. For information on contributing see [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements

- [PHP](http://www.php.net) 5.5.9+ or newer
- A database, either [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) or [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) are recommended but [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) can be used
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- [Redis](http://redis.io)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A suitable [queue](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/queues) for Laravel, [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) is recommended but Redis can also be used

### Optional extras

- [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org) to keep the queue listener and Node.js socket server running
- A [caching server](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/cache), unless you expect a lot of traffic the default `file` cache is probably enough
