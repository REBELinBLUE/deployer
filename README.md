## What it does:
* Deploys applications to multiple servers accessible via SSH
* Clones your projects git repository
* Installs composer dependencies
* Runs arbitrary commands
* Gracefully handles failure in any of these steps
* Keeps a number of previous deployments

## What it doesn't do:
* Provision VMs
* Install system packages
* Configure the web server, database or other services

# Why?

Deployer was heavily inspired by [Envoyer.io](https://envoyer.io), if you want a reliable deployment system I suggest you give Envoyer a try.

Deployer came about as I needed a deployment system for deploying updates for a PHP application to a large number of clients. Although Envoyer was almost perfect it was missing 2 key things I needed

Firstly, I was unable to use a hosted service as it would not be able to connect to the servers I needed to deploy to without a lot of network configuration changes.

Secondly, the code for the application I was deploying was hosted on a Gitlab server, and Envoyer only supports Github & Bitbucket.

For these reasons I decided to make a clone of Envoyer which suited my needs, at the same time using it as an excuse to learn Laravel 5.
